# Project Name

This is the Technigo's boot camp project of week 4. Project was to build a chat bot with JavaScript, HTML and CSS in pairs. So this project was done by Kristiina Kolu and Marianne Ardin.

## The problem

We started to make a structure of the bot questions and user answers by using Figma (see it here: https://www.figma.com/file/K0xs9Lc9284MZmN40ABDUA/Week-4?node-id=87%3A91). We made for every bot question a number and own function and we used innerHTML to show buttons/input/selections with options depending what kind of question we were dealing. Then we had own funtion called nextQuestion where we had if and if else statements to control which question function we wanted to activate depending on what the user answers. At the end we also added some sound effect after every time bot or the user send a message. 

What would have we done if had more time:
- reasearch how to replace innerHTML, because it is not the best practise how to manage content
